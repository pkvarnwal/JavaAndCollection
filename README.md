* ### Interface vs Inheritance

* ### Inheritance: This is one way of achieving both polymorphism and code reuse at the same time.
Inhritance is when a `class` derives from an existing `class`.

* ### Polymorphism: The ability to treat objects of different types in a similar manner.
Ex: Rabbit and tortoise both are animals, and animals can `Move`. 
If you have an instance of an `Animal` then you can call `Move` without knowing which type of animal it is.
