# HashSet

## The underlined data structure for HashSet is HashTable.
### Duplicates are not allowed. If We are trying to insert duplicates, we won't get any compile time Error or Run time Exeception, add() method simply return false. and object wouldn't be added.
### Insertion order is not preserved and all objects will be inserted based on hash-code of objects.
### Heterogenous objects are allowed.
### null insertion is possible.
### Implements Serializable and Clonable interfaces but not RandomAccess.
### HashSet is best choice, if our frequent operation is search operation.
